# Caesar-Algorithmus
## About the Project
The **Ceasar-cipher** is a simple method of **encrypting messages, named after Julius Caesar**. It works by **shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of places**, the standard shift is usually three. For example, the letter "a" would be an encrypted "d".
Keep in mind that text in the frontend is written in german, since i'am a german developer.

## Functionality
### Decrypt text
Write your encrypted text message in the textarea, choose your decryption key with the select-option-field and then click on the button next to it in order to get your decrypted text message. You can easily copy your result using the copy to clipboard button.

## Easter Eggs
### Blurr-Animation
if you hover over the blurred images on the start screen, the blurr-effect becomes clear after five seconds. Therefore you can see the image in detail. Remove the mouse and the image becomes blurred again.
